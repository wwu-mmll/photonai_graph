# PHOTONAI -Graph

This is an extension module to the PHOTONAI Python toolbox. With PHOTONAI Graph, you can create graph embeddings, calculate graph measures, train graph neural networks and use other graph machine learning methods.

    Please consider that this package is still under active development. Use wisely!

## Background

Graphs structures can be found in many different fields from socials networks, to molecular graphs to brain networks. They are very common in biology and neuroscience, for example in the area of connectomics. Graphs provide a natural representation of networks and allow for the study of their properties. In order to make use of the special information that the graph structure provides, different machine learning techniques have been developed. PHOTONAI Graph integrates a lot of these algorithms into the PHOTON framework and makes out-of-the-box models available for the study of graphs.

This allows researchers from a variety of fields to use graph machine learning techniques for their projects and to build pipelines and evaluate them within a few lines of code. 

## Installation

Since PHOTONAI Graph is an extension the PHOTONAI framework, it requires PHOTONAI for building pipelines (though for the use outside of pipelines it is not necessarily required). PHOTONAI Graph can be easily installed after creating a python/conda environment.

```bash
pip install photonai-graph
```
