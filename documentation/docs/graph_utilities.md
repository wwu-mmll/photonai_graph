# Graph Utility functions

The graph utility functions module is a set of utility functions when working with graphs. They contain functions for plotting graphs, converting them and checking for certain properties (for example: checking if the graph asteroidal). The module is split into two main parts: conversion functions, which handle conversions between different graph formats and non-conversion functions (saving/writing graphs, plotting them, ...). These functions can also be used outside of the PHOTONAI Graph framework to handle conversions or check graph layouts.
