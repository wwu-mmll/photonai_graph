# Graph Measures - GraphMeasureTransform


The GraphMeasureTransform class is a transformer, that takes graphs as an input and extracts graph measures from them.

The user can pick from a range of graph measure functions based on networkx (for a list of available measures see xxx). These measures then get concatenated to a list, which can then be fed forward to an estimator, like an SVM.
